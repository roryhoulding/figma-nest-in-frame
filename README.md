# Nest in frame

You know when an object isn't inside a frame, but you thought it was, and so you drag it out to the side then drag it back inside the frame? This plugin is essentially a shortcut for that. 

Nest in frame will nest the selected object inside any frame that it overlaps with.

### Contraints
- Only works if one node is selected
- If the selected object overlaps with multiple frames, it will nest itself inside the first one it finds

### Future features
- Nest in group
- Visual cue on completion (e.g. temporary blue highlight around new parent frame)
- Un-nest from frame
- Nest multiple objects at once
